Hi! Nice to meet you! :wave:

I am Arianna and as a PhD candidate in Applied Linguistics, I conduct research on the modeling of linguistic complexity and its practical applications in the educational and professional contexts. Driven by a fascination for quantitative analysis, I utilize statistical and computational methods within language sciences to help make data-driven, evidence-based decisions in language training.

As a human being outside academia, I am passionate about vintage clothing and the history of Italian political parties during the so-called _First Republic_. Lately, I am learning a little bit of personal finance as well!
